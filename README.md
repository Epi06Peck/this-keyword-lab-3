This lab looked at JavaScripts's "this" keyword behaviour in different scenarios. Particularly in DOM event handlers. The objective was to understand how "this" changes depending on how a function is called, and how to properly apply "this" in those contexts, such as objects and arrow functions. In this lab there were practices involving regular functions, arrow functions, utilization of .bind(), event.currentTarget, and the data-\* attributes that built interactive UI behaviour using vanilla javascript.
